		 - DEFAULT uses a hash that may introduce false positives, but
       this can be useful when inserting large keys that need to be
       hashed down to a small fingerprint.  With this type of hash,
       you can iterate over the hash values of all the keys in the
       CQF, but you cannot iterate over the keys themselves.

		 - INVERTIBLE has no false positives, but the size of the hash
       output must be the same as the size of the hash input,
       e.g. 17-bit keys hashed to 17-bit outputs.  So this mode is
       generally only useful when storing small keys in the CQF.  With
       this hashing mode, you can use iterators to enumerate both all
       the hashes in the CQF, or all the keys.

		 - NONE, for when you've done the hashing yourself.  WARNING: the
		   CQF can exhibit very bad performance if you insert a skewed
			 distribution of intputs.
